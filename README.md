Microsoft Roblox / UWP Roblox mouse fix to stop mouse going off-screen and to lock the mouse in the center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program will limit your mouse movement on the version of ROBLOX on microsoft. 
There is a common bug in UWP ROBLOX where your mouse will move offscreen or not lock in the center of your screen without you holding in right click.
This can be annoying if you're trying to play first person shooter games or other games that rely on your mouse movement, so this is the fix.

- IS THIS LEGIT OR A VIRUS?

- This project was lost when my previous account was hijacked, so this is simply the updated version.
- This is 100% trusted and if flagged as a virus on your computer is probably a false positive since most exe's are flagged.
- When opening the fixer for the first time, it might ask for admin privalliges. This is because it needs them to modify the settings on your ROBLOX so it can fix them.
